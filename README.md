# Frontend Mentor - Article preview component

## Overview

This is my solution to this challenge made by Frontend Mentor. Even though this was supposed to be done with HTML, CSS and Javascript, I didn't use Javascript because I thought it was unnecessary to use it for this challenge. I tried to improve the responsiveness of my sites with this challenge, so any feedback you have is always well received :)
